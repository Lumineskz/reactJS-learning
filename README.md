## My React JS learning experience
This repository is made to document my react learning experience.
### I'm learning React JS From the video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgkZ7MvWUAA
### and their official site


## Learned items:

### 1. Card Components
They are reusable components, for now they're static that shows same value every time.
### 2. Adding CSS and Styles
Adding CSS and styles are similar to how you do it in HTML, except the class naming convention is now "className" instead of the usual "class" in html.
### 3. Props
Props, or properties are a mechanism for passing data or parameters from a parent component to a child component. This way, the card mentioned before can have multiple different values while using the same style. (Very useful in reusability)
#### i. PropTypes:
    A runtime type-checking of props passed to React components, ensures that components recieve data of expected types.
#### ii. DefaultProps:
    In case of any missing values, the defaultValue is used to automatically fill out that missing value by its own defined value.
### 4. Conditional Rendering
It is the practice of displaying different UI elements or components based on specific conditions. Basically, if a condition is true, you can choose whether to render the component or not.
### 5. Render Lists
The map() function of JS is used to render list in ReactJS.  This allows you to iterate over an array of data and transform each of them into React element/components.
